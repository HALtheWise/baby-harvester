# baby-harvester

This branch now exists as documentation of the original path our team followed. When we set out to use Rust and resin, this branch was our master branch. Since pivoting to Python, we have moved over to what is now master, but everything here is still important for demonstrating learning and for any future work we might do on making the original architecture functional. An explanation of the differences between our original architecture and our final architecture, as well as why we switched, can be found [in the wiki here](https://github.com/HALtheWise/baby-harvester/wiki/Deployment-Architecture).
