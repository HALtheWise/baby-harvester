# The Baby Harvester
By Eric Miller, Celina Bekins, and Jared Briskman

In the Olin College Library, we have a tool called the Idea Harvester. The Idea Harvester is about the height of a person, rolls around on caster wheels, and has a variety of features - including an HDMI-enabled screen, a roll of butcher paper, a light, a soldering arm, and a bell.

For this project, we set out to build a Baby Harvester: a mini version of the Idea Harvester. The Baby Harvester stands a little over 10 inches tall and sports a [2.4‚Äù PiTFT screen](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-2-4-pitft-hat-with-resistive-touchscreen-mini-kit?view=all), a [thermal printer](https://learn.adafruit.com/mini-thermal-receipt-printer?view=all), and a button, all connected to a RasPi 3 that sits on the bottom. The Baby Harvester is a platform, meant to enable all kinds of printer and/or screen usage. Outside developers can write apps for the Baby Harvester, as demonstrated [by our sample app](https://github.com/songbird175/harvester-sampleapp). The backend server can be found [here](https://github.com/jaredbriskman/BabyHarvesterGateway).

This project was completed for a class called [Hacking the Library](https://hackingthelibrary.org/), taught at Olin College of Engineering in the Spring of 2018 by Oliver Steele and Jeff Goldenson.
